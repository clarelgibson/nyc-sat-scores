# NYC SAT Scores

A project looking at SAT scores for New York City public schools. Inspired by [this][1] tutorial from [Dataquest][2]. In the tutorial, the instructor completed his data analysis using python. I will be completing my analysis of the same data using R.

## Data

* [SAT scores by school][5] — SAT scores for each high school in New York City.
* [School attendance][6] — attendance information on every school in NYC.
* [Math test results][7] — math test results for every school in NYC.
* [Class size][8] — class size information for each school in NYC.
* [AP test results][9] — Advanced Placement exam results for each high school. Passing AP exams can get you college credit in the US.
* [Graduation outcomes][10] — percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information.
* [Demographics][11] — demographic information for each school.
* [School survey][12] — surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school.
* [School district maps][13] — contains information on the layout of the school districts, so that we can map them out.
